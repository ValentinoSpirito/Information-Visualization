# Information Visualization

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** focused on information visualization techniques, designed to demonstrate various data representation methods.

## Project Overview

In this project, I use interactive tools and visualizations to explore datasets and present insights in an intuitive and accessible way. The notebook includes examples of:

- Data Import and Preprocessing
- Visualizing Data Trends and Patterns
- Interactive Graphs and Plots
- Insights and Annotations in Visualizations

## Content

- **`Valentino_Spirito.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook where all the data visualization processes and insights are documented.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: The notebook walks through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- **Interactive Plots**: Includes dynamic charts using popular libraries such as **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, or **Plotly**.
- **Step-by-Step Explanations**: Detailed comments and markdown sections provide context and guide the user through the process.
